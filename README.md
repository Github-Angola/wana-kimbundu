## Notes
To contribute, you need to have a little knowledge of languages, or at least know that in the Kimbundu language there are no certain letters, so this unofficial translation follows linguistic parameters studied by the maintainer of this project. Remember that some words are not translated from technical English because they do not have a literal and/or semantic translation for other languages, in these cases these words will be kept from the original. as an example we have the word "bit", "byte" and others.
